Apache2-AuthenNTLM-Cookie

DESCRIPTION

This module extends  L<Apache2::AuthenNTLM> with a cookie mechanism.

The parent module L<Apache2::AuthenNTLM> performs user authentication
via Microsoft's NTLM protocol; thanks to this mechanism, users are
automatically recognized from their Windows login, without having to
type a username and password. The server does not have to be a Windows
machine : it can be any platform, provided that it has access to a
Windows domain controller.  On the client side, both Microsoft
Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox implement the NTLM protocol.

The NTLM handshake involves several packet exchanges, and furthermore
requires serialization through an internal semaphore. Therefore, 
in order to improve performance, the present module saves the result
of that handshake in a cookie, so that the next request gets an
immediate answer.

A similar module was already published on CPAN for Apache1 / modperl1 
(L<Apache::AuthCookieNTLM>). The present module is an implementation
for Apache2 / modperl2, and has a a different algorithm for cookie
generation, in order to prevent any attempt to forge a fake cookie.
